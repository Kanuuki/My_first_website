  <p>My First Website!</p>


  <p>This is really cool, I'm builidng a web page!</p>

  <h1>How I Learned About the Amazing World of Computers</h1>
    <p>This is the beginning of my first ever website in HTML</p>

    <p>I've been learning how to program for about a month now.
      I've also quickly come to realize how hard it actually is!
      The cyber security branch of computer since is so complex and confusing.
      It's also super damn fun when you're practicing the material
      you just learned!</p>

    <p> I started out learning what Python and used the
      FreeCodeCamp.org youtube channel. It was 4 hours or something long,
      and to be honest I haven't finished it,
      but I'm about half way through only because I switched courses.
      I went on to use Automate the Boring Stuff by AlSweigart.
      I'm not the type of person to learn from books,
      but the way he explains and add's in mini projects to do is great!
      From then on I went searching all over Reddit,
      I was looking for fun and practical ways of using this language.
      I learned about making a Rock, Paper, Scissors game to a Magic 8 ball.
      After doing those mini projects I went on my own to make a quiz,
      and a number guesser which went well. A couple of project later
      I learned about cyber security and fell down a deep rabbit hole.
