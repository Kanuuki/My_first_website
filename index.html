  <h1> How I Learned About the Amazing World of Computers</h1>

    <p>This is the beginning of my first ever website in HTML</p>
 <!-- <em> stands for 'emphasis' and this makes text italic-->
    <p>I've been learning how to program for about a month now.
      <em>I've also quickly come to realize how hard it actually is!</em>
      The cyber security branch of computer since is so complex and confusing.
      It's also super damn fun when you're practicing the material
      you just learned!</p>

<!-- you can combine <strong> and <em> to make text bold AND italic -->

<!-- dont use <b> and <i> !!! -->

    <p> <strong>I started out learning</strong> what <a style="color: #c6c639" href="https://www.python.org/">Python</a> is and used the
      FreeCodeCamp.org youtube channel. It was 4 hours or something long,
      and to be honest I haven't finished it,
      but I'm about half way through only because I switched courses.
      I went on to use <b><a style="color: #c6c639" href="https://automatetheboringstuff.com/2e/chapter0/">Automate the Boring Stuff by AlSweigart.</a></b>
      I'm not the type of person to learn from books,
      but the way he explains and add's in mini projects to do is great!
      From then on I went searching all over Reddit,
      I was looking for fun and practical ways of using this language.
      I learned about making a Rock, Paper, Scissors game to a Magic 8 ball.
      After doing those mini projects I went on my own to make a quiz,
      and a number guesser which went well. <strong>A couple of projects later
      I learned about <a style="color: #c6c639" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cybersecurity_information_technology_list">
      cyber security</a> and fell down a deep rabbit hole.</strong> </p>

    <p> I've always wanted to learn how to hack
      like those guys in those <a style="color: #c6c639" href="page_two.html">corny movies</a>. Now that my brain
      is developed I've realized those are absolutley fake and
      hilarious how bad they are.</p>

    <p> When I first started learning about hacking, I was directed to a website.
      It's name is <a style="color: #c6c639" href="https://overthewire.org/wargames/">OverTheWire</a>
      and It teaches you how to navigate the terminal and find what are called "flags"
      that unlock the path to the next level. Like all games, it started out eazy.
      I got stuck on level 14 because of how confusing it is. A good thing about
      that is I learned how to use the CLI and am now more comfortable using it
      than a file system GUI</p>

    <p > After I did some of Bandit in OverTheWire, I went on to a website called
      <a style="color: #c6c639" href="https://tryhackme.com"> tryhackme.</a> It has a decent amount of free
        content that it offers, and for only $10 you unlock a bunch of features
        and courses that teach you about <a style="color: #c6c639" href"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penetration_test">
        penetration testing</a> and the many ways of getting inside of something
        securely locked down. The website also teaches about <a style="color: #c6c639" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proactive_cyber_defence">
        cyber defense</a> and how to protect yourself from attacks and malware.
        Since I've never done any of this before in my life, I started out with
        Complete Beginner and even that is whooping my ass. There's so much to
        learn about and understand and it's <em>overwhelming</em>
